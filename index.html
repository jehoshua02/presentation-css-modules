# CSS! What a Mess!

---

# Modules

With the advent of modules in Javascript, we all learned there was a better way to organize code.

---

# CSS ... *le sigh*

But alas, we carry some baggage into this brave new world. We dream of building modular, highly reusable, composable UI components but CSS makes this quite difficult.

class: center, middle

# Why?

---

# Globals

For decades, the experienced have told us about the terrors of globals.

---

# Dependencies

It's quite difficult to track down what depends on what and visual regressions are oh so easy to introduce. Dare we remove this CSS? Nay, we dare not.

---

# Dead Code Elimination

Because dependencies are not explicit and often our html is dynamically generated it is difficult if not impossible to eliminate dead css.
